Description: Learning Dart in Spirals by Developing Magic Boxes.
The last spiral is a graphical model designer.
The JSON representation of a model is generated in Magic Boxes. 
This representation is used in the 
[Dartling] (https://github.com/dzenanr/dartling) domain model framework to 
generate code for the model.
